# 1. WHY IS WORLD HISTORY LIKE AN ONION ?
- THIS BOOK ATTEMPTS TO PROVIDE A SHORT HISTORY OF everybody for the last 13,000 years. The question motivating the book is: Why did history unfold differently on different continents?
- Most books that set out to recount world history concentrate on histories of literate Eurasian and North African societies. Native societies of other parts of the world—sub-Saharan Africa, the Americas, Island South- east Asia, Australia, New Guinea, the Pacific Islands—receive only brief treatment,
- History before the emergence of writing around 3,000 B.C. also receives brief treatment, although it constitutes 99.9% of the five-million-year history of the human species.
- the reviewer wrote that I seem to view world history as an onion, of which the modern world constitutes only the surface, and whose layers are to be peeled back in the search for historical understanding. Yes, world history is indeed such an onion! But that peeling back of the onion's layers is fascinating, challenging—and of overwhelm- ing importance to us today, as we seek to grasp our past's lessons for our future.
# 2. YALI'S QUESTION
### Process of The Question
- WE ALL KNOW T H A T H I S T O R Y HAS P R O C E E D E D VERY D I F -
ferently for peoples from different parts of the globe. In the
13,000 years since the end of the last Ice Age, some parts of the world :
    1. developed literate industrial societies with metal tools, other parts developed only (yang mendominasi)
    2. nonliterate farming societies, and still others retained societies of 
    3. hunter-gatherers with stone tools.

- Two centuries ago, all New Guineans were still "living in the Stone Age." That is, they still used stone tools similar to those superseded in Europe by metal tools thousands of years ago, and they dwelt in villages not organized under any centralized political authority.

### The Question
- Peoples of Eurasian origin, especially those still living in Europe and eastern Asia, plus those transplanted to North America, dominate the modern world in wealth and power. Other peoples, including most Africans, have thrown off European colonial domination but remain far behind in wealth and power. Still other peoples, such as the aboriginal inhabitants of Australia, the Americas, and southernmost Africa, are no longer even masters of their own lands but have been decimated, subjugated, and in some cases even exterminated by European colonialists.
#### Why did wealth and power become distributed as they now are, rather than in some other way? For instance, why weren't Native Americans, Africans, and Aboriginal Australians the ones who decimated, subjugated, or exterminated Europeans and Asians?
- We can easily push this question back one step. As of the year A.D.1500, when Europe's worldwide colonial expansion was just beginning, peoples on different continents already differed greatly in technology and political organization :
    1. Much of Europe, Asia, and North Africa was the site of metal-equipped states or empires, some of them on the threshold of industrialization. 
    2. Two Native American peoples, the Aztecs and the Incas, ruled over empires with stone tools. 
    3. Parts of sub-Saharan Africa were divided among small states or chiefdoms with iron tools. 
    4. Most other peoples including all those of Australia and New Guinea, many Pacific islands, much of the Americas, and small parts of sub-Saharan Africa lived as farming tribes or even still as hunter-gatherer bands using stone tools.
- Kita mundur lagi, perbedaan teknologi dan politik di A.D. 1500 memang yang membuat perbedaan kemajuan pada jaman modern sekarang, karena kerajaan yang memiliki senjata besi bisa mengalahkan senjata kayu dan batu. Lalu apa yang menyebabkan perbedaan antara di 1 daerah sudah menggunakan besi, di daerah lain masih memakai batu ?
- Setelah ice age, sekitar 11.000 B.C, all peoples on all continents were still hunter-gatherers. Different rates of development on different continents, from 11,000 B.C. to A.D. 1500, were what led to the technological and political inequalities of A.D. 1500. 
- Perbedaan- perbedaan :
    1. While Aboriginal Australians and many Native Americans remained hunter-gatherers, most of Eurasia and much of the Americas and sub-Saharan Africa gradually developed agriculture, herding, metallurgy, and complex political organization. Parts of Eurasia, and one area of the Americas, independently developed writing as well.
    2. However, each of these new developments appeared earlier in Eurasia than elsewhere. For instance, the mass production of bronze tools, which was just beginning in the South American Andes in the centuries before A.D. 1500, was already established in parts of Eurasia over 4,000 years earlier. The stone technology of the Tasmanians, when first encoun- tered by European explorers in A.D. 1642, was simpler than that prevalent in parts of Upper Paleolithic Europe tens of thousands of years earlier.
- `In addition` to these current political and economic reverberations of past collisions among peoples, there are current linguistic reverberations especially the impending disappearance of most of the modern world's 6,000 surviving languages, becoming replaced by English, Chinese, Russian, and a few other languages whose numbers of speakers have increased enormously in recent centuries. All these problems of the modern world result from the different historical trajectories implicit in Yali's question.
- Pemahaman sebelum menjawab pertanyaan Yali :
    1. Mencari tau apa yang membuat suatu daerah bisa menguasai daerah lain, bukan untuk membenarkannya, tapi mencari tau apa yang menyebabkannya, seperti halnya ahli psikologi yang mempelari plikologi dari pelaku genocide, atau dokter yang mempelajari penyakit
    2. Tidak ada maksud untuk glorifikasi barat, atau eurocentris terhadap sejarah.
    3. Industrisasi dan kemajuan peradaban, bukan berarti sesuatu yang baik, apakah kemajuan peradaban menjadi perkembangan kebahagiaan manusia?, modernisasi memang ada dampak baik, tapi ada jga dampak buruknya. My motive for investigating these geographic differences in human societies is not to celebrate one type of society over another but simply to understand what happened in history.

### The Answers (Prediksi-prediksi)
1. A genetic (innate ability) explanation isn't the only possible answer to Yali's question.(18-22)  
2. Popular with inhabitants of northern Europe, invokes the supposed stimulatory effects of their homeland's cold climate and the inhibitory effects of hot, humid, tropical climates on human creativity and energy.
    - Bantahan : As we shall see, the peoples of northern Europe contributed nothing of fundamental importance to Eurasian civilization until the last thousand years; they simply had the good luck to live at a geographic location where they were likely to receive advances (such as agriculture, wheels, writing, and metallurgy) developed in warmer parts of Eurasia. In the New World the cold regions at high latitude were even more of a human backwater. The sole Native American societies to develop writing arose in Mexico south of the Tropic of Cancer; the oldest New World pottery comes from near the equator in tropical South America; and the New World society generally considered the most advanced in art, astronomy, and other respects was the Classic Maya society of the tropical Yucatan and Guatemala in the first millennium A.D.
3. the supposed importance of lowland river valleys in dry climates, where highly productive agriculture depended on large-scale irrigation systems that in turn required centralized bureaucracies.
    - Reason : act that the earliest known empires and writing systems arose in the Tigris and Euphrates Valleys of the Fertile Crescent and in the Nile Valley of Egypt. Water control systems also appear to have been associated with centralized political organization in some other areas of the world, including the Indus Valley of the Indian subcontinent, the Yellow and Yangtze Valleys of China, the Maya lowlands of Mesoamerica, and the coastal desert of Peru.
