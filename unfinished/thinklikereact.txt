A START WITH A MOCK
  1) Imagine that we already have a JSON API and a mock from our designer.
     --> The mock looks like this:
        pic
     --> Our JSON API returns some data that looks like this:
         [
          {category: "Sporting Goods", price: "$49.99", stocked: true, name: "Football"},
          {category: "Sporting Goods", price: "$9.99", stocked: true, name: "Baseball"},
          {category: "Sporting Goods", price: "$29.99", stocked: false, name: "Basketball"},
          {category: "Electronics", price: "$99.99", stocked: true, name: "iPod Touch"},
          {category: "Electronics", price: "$399.99", stocked: false, name: "iPhone 5"},
          {category: "Electronics", price: "$199.99", stocked: true, name: "Nexus 7"}
        ];

1 STEP 1 : BREAK THE UI INTO A COMPONENT HIERARCHY
  1) The first thing you’ll want to do is to draw boxes around every component (and subcomponent) in the mock and give them all names
     --> But how do you know what should be its own component? Just use the same techniques for deciding if you should create a new function or object. One such technique is the single responsibility principle, that is, a component should ideally only do one thing. If it ends up growing, it should be decomposed into smaller subcomponents.
     --> Since you’re often displaying a JSON data model to a user, you’ll find that if your model was built correctly, your UI (and therefore your component structure) will map nicely. That’s because UI and data models tend to adhere to the same information architecture
  --> You’ll see here that we have five components in our simple app. We’ve italicized the data each component represents.
      1. FilterableProductTable (orange): contains the entirety of the example
      2. SearchBar (blue): receives all user input
      3. ProductTable (green): displays and filters the data collection based on user input
      4. ProductCategoryRow (turquoise): displays a heading for each category
      5. ProductRow (red): displays a row for each product
  --> If you look at ProductTable, you’ll see that the table header (containing the “Name” and “Price” labels) isn’t its own component. This is a matter of preference, and there’s an argument to be made either way. For this example, we left it as part of ProductTable because it is part of rendering the data collection which is ProductTable’s responsibility. However, if this header grows to be complex (i.e. if we were to add affordances for sorting), it would certainly make sense to make this its own ProductTableHeader component.
  --> Now that we’ve identified the components in our mock, let’s arrange them into a hierarchy :
      FilterableProductTable
        SearchBar
        ProductTable
          ProductCategoryRow
          ProductRow
